Normalization is a database design technique that organizes data in a relational database to reduce redundancy and dependency. The main goals of normalization are to eliminate data anomalies, ensure data integrity, and create a well-structured database that is easy to maintain and update. Here are the key concepts of normalization:

1. Issues Addressed by Normalization:
Data Redundancy: Repetition of data in large relations.
Difficulty in Maintenance: Searching through many records for updates.
Wastage of Disk Space: Poor utilization of resources.
Increased Likelihood of Errors: Inconsistencies in the data.

2. What is Normalization?
Definition: The process of organizing data in the database.
Objective: Minimize redundancy, eliminate anomalies (Insertion, Update, Deletion), and divide large tables into smaller, well-structured relations.
Achieved by: Decomposing relations into relations with fewer attributes.

3. Why Do We Need Normalization?
Data Modification Anomalies: Insertion, Deletion, and Updation Anomalies.
Insertion Anomaly: Inability to insert new data due to missing information.
Deletion Anomaly: Unintended loss of important data during deletion.
Updation Anomaly: Requirement to update multiple rows for a single data value update.
Data Integrity Issues: Failure to eliminate anomalies leads to data integrity problems as the database grows.

4. Types of Normal Forms:
1NF (First Normal Form): Atomic values in a relation.
2NF (Second Normal Form): 1NF + Non-key attributes fully functionally dependent on the primary key.
3NF (Third Normal Form): 2NF + No transitive dependency exists.
BCNF (Boyce Codd's Normal Form): A stronger definition of 3NF.
4NF (Fourth Normal Form): BCNF + No multi-valued dependency.
5NF (Fifth Normal Form): 4NF + No join dependency, joining should be lossless.

5. Advantages of Normalization:
Data Redundancy Reduction: Minimizes data duplication.
Greater Database Organization: Well-structured and easy to manage.
Data Consistency: Maintains consistency within the database.
Flexible Database Design: Supports changes in requirements.
Relational Integrity: Enforces relational integrity concepts.

6. Disadvantages of Normalization:
Need for Clear User Requirements: Database design requires a clear understanding of user needs.
Performance Degradation: Higher normalization forms (e.g., 4NF, 5NF) may degrade performance.
Time-Consuming Process: Normalizing relations to higher degrees is time-consuming.
Risk of Bad Database Design: Careless decomposition may lead to design problems.
